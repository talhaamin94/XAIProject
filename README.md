<h1 style="text-align : center">XAIProject</h1>

## Environment Details
The code file named test contains all the code required to run the project. The project is based on explaining graph neural networks using GNNExplainer. 
The python version used to create this project is python 3.8.10. All the package requirements are contained in requirements.txt. 
There is no data file for the graph as it is being generated by the code on runtime. 

## Code Output 
The explanations of data are based on the graph BAShapes as per the description provided in the original GNNExplainer paper. You can find the rest of the details in the project report. When you run the code, the program generates graphs containing saliency maps for a few explanations of the predictions made by the GNN. The graphs are saved individually as .png files. Each time, the graphs might be different because of different nodes being selected as the train/test split might vary. The code also contains comments explaining functionality.
